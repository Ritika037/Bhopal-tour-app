    <string name="momo_cafe_about">An excellent restaurant with staff who cater to your personal requirements. We stayed at the hotel for over a week and were happy to be obliged with dishes made to our requirements and taste. Chef Ravi Patel did an excellent job of preparing our mix veg without gravy and fresh as per taste . Also the ever smiling faces of Ajay and Suraj serving us and welcoming us for meals three times a day is noteworthy considering the long hours they put in . They blocked our table for the stay , kept minor details like iced drinking water and papads ready as soon as we sat down. You must ask for Chicken Tangdi kebab and Mutton Galouti kebab prepared by Chef Ravi and is a must have</string>
